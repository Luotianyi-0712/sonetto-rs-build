Download latest build from [releases page](https://github.com/Luotianyi-0712/sonetto-rs-build/releases/tag/latest)

- sdkserver and gameserver will be in the target/release directory
- you can move these two files to another location if you want
- in the same folder as sdkserver and gameserver make a [data](https://gitlab.com/yoncodes/sonetto-data) folder（`data/`） next to those binaries and copy `excel2json` and the `static/` folder into it.
- need to use the [sonetto patch](https://github.com/yoncodes/sonetto-patch) to make the game work with the server
- now open two terminals or command prompts
